FJ Project

- Injector open for 3 ms at 1000 RPM
- At 6000 RPM, it can be open for 12-15 ms
- Have adjustment to have only one open at a time. for 4 injectors, 1 3 4 2 is firing order
- Support 6 injectors (option to have 6 or 4 injectors)
- LED lights that light up with fuel injector

injectors go from from 2 ms to 15 ms

injector feeds for 15ms. then it closes. It is closed for 2 turns of the engine

injector injects onces per two turns of engine

Example: engine runs at 1000 RPM

2 ms to 15 ms is always the range of time that it is open
Injector opens every two rotations of the engine



Issue with Arduino/Protothreads/Printing to LCD Every Frame:
- If printing to LCD screen every frame, digital output to pins other than 13 does not work.

Possible Solution:
    - Only drive the fuel injectors when in DRIVE_INJECTORS mode. In this mode, the UI is not updated. After exiting this mode, the UI will become responsive again.

    
Plan to modify Prototyping Board:
De-solder the 4 female header pins and the 4 male header pins
- Replaced the male header pins with stackable female header pins.
    
Plans (3/18/18):
- Remove the '5V' and 'GND' 5-hole header pins to make room for new positions of LEDS
- Try to support 6 injectors
    - Pins 1 and 0 are available, should use 1 as 6th pin.
    - Need to program 6 injector as a possible configuration option
- Create "Auto-Test" mode that runs through RPMs in increments of 500 from 0 to 8000, remaining on each one for 5 seconds
- Use the Flash/EPPROM storage on Arduino to store configuration information
